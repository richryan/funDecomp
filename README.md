Code for the paper 
*Unemployment Volatility: When Workers Pay Costs upon Accepting Jobs*.
The paper is included in the top of the directory in 
`unemployment_volatility_when_workers_pay_costs.pdf`.

Here's the abstract:

> When a firm hires a worker,
>   adding the new hire to payroll is costly.
>   These costs
>   reduce the amount of resources that can go to recruiting workers
>   and % This % affects
>   amplify how unemployment responds to changes in productivity.
>   Workers also incur up-front costs upon accepting jobs.
>   Examples include moving expenses and regulatory fees.
>   I establish that workers' costs
>   lessen the response of unemployment to productivity changes and
>   do not subtract from resources available for recruitment.
>   The influence of workers' costs is bounded by properties of a matching function,
>   which describes how
>   job openings and unemployment produce hires.
>   Using data on job finding that are adjusted
>   for workers' transitions between employment and unemployment and 
>   for how the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey records hires,
>   I estimate a bound that ascribes limited influence to workers' costs. 
>   The results demonstrate that costs paid by workers upon accepting jobs
>   affect outcomes in the labor market
>   (firms threaten workers with paying the up-front costs again if wage
>   negotiations fail),
>   but their influence on volatility is less important than firms' costs.
